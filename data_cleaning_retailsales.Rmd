### Context

This project is for the Google Analytics Capstone. It is aimed at evaluating the impact of weather patterns on consumer purchase patterns in Kentucky. We will be using retail sales data retrieved from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

The purpose of this script is to perform data cleaning on the monthly retail sales and put all categories into a single dataframe.

### Installing required packages

```{r tidyverse}
install.packages("tidyverse") # for data import and wrangling
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r lubridate}
install.packages("lubridate") # for date functions
library(lubridate)
```

### Loading useful packages from the tydiverse

```{r Packages for data manipulation}
library(tidyr) # for data cleaning
library(dplyr) # for data transformation & exploration
```

### Loading retail sales data

```{r Retail sales data}
food_beverage <- read_csv("Food_Beverage.csv")
clothing <- read_csv("Clothing.csv")
furniture <- read_csv("Health_PersonalCare.csv")
personal_care <- read_csv("Health_PersonalCare.csv")
gasoline_stations <- read_csv("Gasoline_stations.csv")
```

### Viewing retail sales data for all categories

```{r View Sales data}
View(food_beverage)
View(clothing)
View(furniture)
View(personal_care)
View(gasoline_stations)
```

### Begin data cleaning

- Renaming the "MSRSKY###" columns to "prct_change" which stands for percent change from year ago

```{r Renaming columns}
foodbev_rename <- rename(food_beverage, prct_change = MSRSKY445)

clothing_rename <- rename(clothing, prct_change = MSRSKY448)

furniture_rename <- rename(furniture, prct_change = MSRSKY446)

personalcare_rename <- rename(personal_care, prct_change = MSRSKY446)

gasstations_rename <- rename(gasoline_stations, prct_change = MSRSKY447)
```

- Making columns format consistent

```{r Format consistent}
foodbev <- rename_with(foodbev_rename, tolower)
clothes <- rename_with(clothing_rename, tolower)
home_furniture <- rename_with(furniture_rename, tolower)
personalcare <- rename_with(personalcare_rename, tolower)
gasstations <- rename_with(gasstations_rename, tolower)
```

- Putting each category in its dataframe

```{r Data frames}
foodbev_df <- data.frame(date = foodbev$date, prct_change = foodbev$prct_change)

clothing_df <- data.frame(date = clothes$date, prct_change = clothes$prct_change)

furniture_df <- data.frame(date = home_furniture$date, prct_change = home_furniture$prct_change)

personalcare_df <- data.frame(date = personalcare$date, prct_change = personalcare$prct_change)

gasstations_df <- data.frame(date = gasstations$date, prct_change = gasstations$prct_change)
```

- Putting all the retail sales data to a single dataframe

```{r Retail sales dataframe}
retail_sales_df <- data.frame(
  date = foodbev_df$date, 
  food_beverage = foodbev_df$prct_change,
  clothing = clothing_df$prct_change,
  furnitures = furniture_df$prct_change,
  personal_care = personalcare_df$prct_change,
  gasoline_stations = gasstations_df$prct_change
  )
```

- The missing values in the percent change data are represented as ".", which makes R assign char as the datatype
- Change the missing values to NA

```{r Installing naniar}
install.packages("naniar") # contains the needed function
library(naniar)
```
```{r Missing values to NA}
retail_sales <- retail_sales_df %>% 
  replace_with_na(replace = list(food_beverage = ".", clothing = ".", furnitures = ".", personal_care = ".", gasoline_stations = "."))
```

- Still, datatypes for food_beverage and clothing need to be changed to numeric

```{r Convert to numeric}
foodbev_num <- as.numeric(as.character(retail_sales$food_beverage))
clothing_num <- as.numeric(as.character(retail_sales$clothing))
```

- Finally, the clean retail sales data in one dataframe

```{r Final retail sales dataframe}
retail_sales_clean <- data.frame(
  date = retail_sales$date, 
  food_beverage = foodbev_num, 
  clothing = clothing_num,
  furnitures = retail_sales$furnitures,
  personal_care = retail_sales$personal_care,
  gasoline_stations = retail_sales$gasoline_stations
  )
```

- Examine final dataframe

```{r Last check}
View(retail_sales_clean)
str(retail_sales_clean)
colnames(retail_sales_clean)
```
